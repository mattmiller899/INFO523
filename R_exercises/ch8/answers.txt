1.	Build a decision tree (regression or classification) and use one ensemble method on your own dataset.

Built a classification decision tree, as well as tried bagging for the ensemble method

2.	List at least two interesting rules from the decision tree your generated.

`when underweight_children is 5.4 to 28.8 & gdp_total_ppp is 2.5e+11 to 3.8e+11 & adults_hiv < 6.45`

`when underweight_children >= 39.7 & gdp_total_ppp >= 8.4e+10`

3.	Does the ensemble method improve the performance on your dataset?

Error rate drops from 0.8 with classification decision tree to 0.7 with bagging, note that we only did 10 rounds of bagging, as it was taking forever to run on a laptop.
